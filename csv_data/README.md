# CSV Results

## bug_struct.csv

This file contains information about the structure of the different faults.

#### Schema: 
- bug-ID: the fault's ID in project-faultNumber(f) format
- \# Lines Addition: the number of lines with additions in the fault patch
- \# Lines Removals: the number of lines with deletions in the fault patch
- \# Total Modified Lines: the sum of the two previous numbers, i.e. the total number of lines modified by the patch.

## distances.csv

This file contains information about the distance between mutants' locations and the faults' patch code.

#### Schema:
- Bug-ID: the fault's ID in project-faultNumber(f) format
- Mutation Tool: the tool with which a mutant has been generated
- Revealing: whether the mutant is coupled to the fault (fault-revealing)
- Mutation ID: the ID of the mutant. An integer for Major's mutants (see merged_valid_maps for details about the mutants) and mutatedClass-mutatedMethod-lineNumber-mutatorClass-indexNumber-blockNumber for Pitest's mutants
- Distance: the distance in number of lines, between the line affected by the mutant and the lines modified by the fault's patch.

## major_mutators.csv

This file contains information about the number of mutants generated by Major's different operators for each fault.

#### Schema:
- Bug-ID: the fault's ID in project-faultNumber(f) format
- [Operator]-Revealing: Number of mutants coupled to the fault generated by operator [Operator]
- [Operator]-Non-Revealing: Number of mutants not coupled to the fault (but covered by the tests) generated by operator [Operator]
- [Operator]-No-Coverage: Number of mutants covered by no tests generated by operator [Operator]

## mutators.csv

This file records which mutation operators created mutants for each fault.

#### Schema:
- Bug-ID: the fault's ID in project-faultNumber(f) format
- Mutation Tool: the tool which operators are listed
- Operators: a comma separated list of all operators from the tool that generated mutants for this fault

## pit_mutators.csv

This file contains information about the number of mutants generated by Pitest's different operators for each fault.

#### Schema:
- Bug-ID: the fault's ID in project-faultNumber(f) format
- [Operator]-Revealing: Number of mutants coupled to the fault generated by operator [Operator]
- [Operator]-Non-Revealing: Number of mutants not coupled to the fault (but covered by the tests) generated by operator [Operator]
- [Operator]-No-Coverage: Number of mutants covered by no tests generated by operator [Operator]

## report.csv

This file contains information about whether each tool created coupled mutants for each fault, and the number of mutants and coupled mutants generated by each tool.

#### Schema:
- Bug-ID: the fault's ID in project-faultNumber(f) format
- MAJOR fault-revealed: whether Major generated a mutant coupled to this fault
- MAJOR # revealing mutants: number of mutants coupled to the fault generated by Major
- MAJOR # mutants: number of mutants generated by Major for this fault
- PIT fault-revealed: whether Pitest generated a mutant coupled to this fault
- PIT # revealing mutants: number of mutants coupled to the fault generated by Pitest
- PIT # mutants: number of mutants generated by Pitest for this fault
- Total # revealing mutants: total number of mutants coupled to this fault
